To start the vortex:
cd ~/Desktop/dream-vortex
./dream-scenes2e.vroom

Assign all buttons:
   right, white button to 6 DOF Input Device
   right, upper trigger button to Gui Interaction so you can get rid of accidental dialogs
   all others, including joy sticks: "Do Nothing"
   There should be no main menu assignment, and there is no way to kill assignments
   
If the program doesn't start and you get only a few lines on the monitor, the vr-device-daemon may need to be restarted:
   sudo service vr-dev<tab> restart
      madeindavis

If the TV isn't getting a signal:
   sudo service 3d<tab> restart
or
   sudo service 3d<tab> stop
   sudo service 3d<tab> start
(sometimes the restart tries to start it again too quickly, I think)

Use the settings to change the volume of the chimes
Change the volume on my ipod for the background noise - it's on the floor under the table
   Speakers have to be on, and I don't know that they'll last the whole time
   
Glasses with the red tape on them cut out frequently.
Batteries for the glasses are behind the monitor.

'''
Base class(es) for graphical objects in vroom
Dawn Sumner, Djerassi, July 2014

Idea: 
Graphical objects have a:
   description, with special features such as multiple points, colors, textures, etc
   position for the "center of mass" of the object relative to the point locations
   rotation relative to the point locations
   scale relative to the point locations
In openGL and with graphics cards, it is computationally efficient to keep the original object description and translate/rotate/scale where it is drawn rather than recalculate the locations of all the points in the object.  

Thus, create a graphical object class for Vroom to hold the description plus transformations in a uniform structure so that they can be systematically drawn.

def transform(item):
   '''Performs the OpenGL transformations to place objects 
   in the correct locations for Vroom
   Input format: [[x,y,z],[rx,ry,rz],s] where 
         x,y,z gives translations
         rx,ry,rz gives rotations around the x, y and z axes, respectively
         s gives the scaling factor

   #probably better to implement as a dictionary with names for the transforms so that some can be left out without shifting all the other values - see vroom implementation of translate and rotate - they aren't what's written in documentation exactly

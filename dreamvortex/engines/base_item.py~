class BaseItem:
   '''Provides a superclass for dream vortex objects, including lifetime, 
   dynamics (if calculated by vortex), age and translations/rotations/scale.  
   BaseItem also provides a step method (pass) and raises an exception if the
   draw method is not defined in the subclass.  A method is provided to remove
   objects if their age > lifetime or if they are > 2 below the floor.
